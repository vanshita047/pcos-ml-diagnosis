# pcos-ml-diagnosis
This project applies machine learning techniques to assist in early diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). It compares multiple models to evaluate performance and provides insights on key indicators.

## Objective:
Build a predictive model for PCOS diagnosis using clinical and hormonal data and evaluate model performance.

## Features:
- Comparison of three machine learning models:
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Feature importance analysis for clinical insight

## Technologies Used:
- WEKA for data preprocessing and ML modeling
- CSV and ARFF datasets

## Notes:
- Decision Tree model provided the best accuracy and interpretability
- Demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare research
